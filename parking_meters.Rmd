## Background


![](img/cool_park.gif)

- 105 metered spaces around the Downtown mall
- Started September 5, 2017
- City council cancels pilot on January 2, 2018 (planned to run until March 5th)
- \$51K in revenue (meters cost \$50K)


## More info

- Goals
    - Improve access to short term parking spaces
    - Get long-term parkers to use the decks
    - Use revenue for mall improvement projects
    
- Concerns
    - Businnesses worried about meters decreasing patron traffic
    - Also about employee parking

## The meters

```{r read_in, cache = T}
dat <- geojson_read("https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d68e620e74e74ec1bd0184971e82ffaa_15.geojson",
                    parse = TRUE)

dat %<>% .[["features"]] %>% .[[2]]

names(dat) %<>% tolower()

# * Locations ----
locs <- distinct(dat, meter_lat, meter_long) # 41 of them

leaflet(locs) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat= ~meter_lat, lng= ~meter_long)

```

## Weekly revenues

```{r}
dat$date <- as.POSIXct(dat$date_payment, format = "%Y/%m/%d")

tmp <- strsplit(dat$parkingendtime, " ") # split column into date, clock:time, AM/PM parts

dat$time <- map_chr(tmp, ~.[2]) %>% # get clock:time from each 2nd slot
    as.POSIXct(format = "%H:%M:%S")

pm_add <- ifelse(grepl("PM", dat$parkingendtime) & !grepl(" 12:", dat$time), #
                 43200,
                 0)

dat$time %<>% add(pm_add)

dat %<>% filter(transactiontype != "Collect. Card")

dat$week <- isoweek(dat$date) %>% as.factor()
dat$day <- wday(dat$date, T)
dat$hour <- hour(dat$time)

week_rev <- group_by(dat, week, day) %>%
    summarise(rev = sum(total))

ggplot(week_rev, aes(week, rev, fill = day)) +
    geom_col()
```

- First and last weeks are partial
- No decline over the program

## Weekly patterns

```{r weekly}
rev_by_day <- group_by(dat, day) %>% 
    summarise(revenue = sum(total))

ggplot(rev_by_day, aes(day, revenue, fill = day)) +
    geom_col()
```

- Sundays are dead
- Weekend revenue is greater

## Daily patterns

```{r, fig.height = 4}
group_by(dat, hour, day) %>%
    summarise(rev = sum(total)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(hour, rev, colour = day, group = day)) +
    geom_path(size = 1.5) +
    scale_color_d3() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(8,12,17,20), labels = c("8a", "12p", "5p", "8p"))
```

- Every day spikes at lunch & dinner
- A lot more lunch outings on Friday
- Monday happy hour?

## \$tats

Average meter fee:

```{r}
mean(dat$total) %>% round(2)
```

Program revenue: 

```{r}
sum(dat$total)
```

Projected yearly revenue:
```{r}
week_rev <- group_by(dat, week) %>%
    summarise(rev = sum(total)) %>%
    slice(c(-1, -n()))

mean(week_rev$rev) * 52
```

## Wrap up

- City estimates they will take a loss due to secondary costs (vandalism, consultant)

![](img/wtf.gif)

- Why did they cancel early?
    - On track for profit
    - Meters already paid for

## Follow ups

- More data 
    - How much was the consultant?
    - What report did the city council see?
    - Do businesses have data showing lost revenue?
    
- More transparent government
    - Open data for all city decisions
    - Public support
    - Less backroom, more accountability
